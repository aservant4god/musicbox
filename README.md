I hope to design a GUI front-end to a directory of chordpro tab sheets. 
Goals of the web page would be to have: 
  * an easy way to search or browse all tabs 
  * display the tab in pdf using perl's chordpro module
  * links for song audio to play along to
  * links for or lead lines 
  * the ability to transpose the tab on the fly 
  * possibly transpose the audio as well
